            Since I was a child, I have always had a fascination with fashion
            and makeup. My mother mentioned that my preschool teacher told her
            that when other children pull out books to read and play with
            kitchen stuff, I used to put on clothes and do catwalks. I guess
            that's when I first fell in love with fashion and makeup. A few
            years ago, I was battling depression. During that time, I resumed my
            makeup journey, and opened an{" "}
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/its.nahida/">Instagram</a>{" "}
            account. Today, this is one of my favorite hobbies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than makeup, I enjoy taking photos of nature, playing with
            paper and pen, creating paintings, gardening, and sometimes working
            out. I believe art and creativity is one of my fortes. I like to
            imagine, play with colors, and always evolve as an artist. By the
            way, did I forget to mention how much I love food? Yeah, I am a
            foodie. In my spare time, I travel to different places in Stockholm
            and try out different types of food. My favorite is a hot bowl of
            Ramen{" "}
